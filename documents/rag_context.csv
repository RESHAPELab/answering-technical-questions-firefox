Question,Cognita Context,Answer RAG
"<@suppressed_user> Hi team 👋,
Hope everybody is doing well.
We have a couple of [crash reports](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1873619) on Android, coming from `libutils.so`, with the below stack.
Is somebody familiar with this?
 
```
Reason: SIGSEGV / SEGV_MAPERR

1  boot.oat  boot.oat@0x3844a0  
2  ?  @0x00006e90148652e4

Source: testing/web-platform/meta/mixed-content/gen/top.meta/opt-in/sharedworker-import.https.html.ini","Hi 👋, the crash reports indicate a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) in libutils.so, which is a common library in Android's native code. The specific address libutils.so@0xede0 suggests an issue within that library, but without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause. This could be due to memory corruption, invalid memory access, or a bug in the library itself. It would be helpful to gather more information, such as the Android version, device model, and steps to reproduce the crash. Additionally, checking for updates or patches for libutils.so might provide a solution.

Add a comment to the bug saying 'review ping?', check the ""Need more information from"" box, and add the reviewer's name. If there is still no response within a day or two, you can ask for help on Matrix in the #introduction:mozilla.org or #developers:mozilla.org channels. Additionally, you can tag more reviewers or use review groups like #geckoview-reviewers in Phabricator to notify more people.

"<@suppressed_user> I have a problem that's hard to debug -- `./mach test toolkit/components/extensions/test/xpcshell/test_ext_webRequest_responseBody.js` --- I get a timeout on the initial test in parallel. On the retry (`Retrying tests that failed when run in parallel`) to run the xpcshell tests sequentially, I get an assertion. What I really want it to get an rr trace of the assertion, but if I use --debugger=rr, it never times out the initial test, so we never get to the one that fails.
 
Any suggestions?

"<@suppressed_user> Hi everyone. So recently I have run into this problem when I try to pull from the Mozilla build because I am trying to start on a good first bug. My issue is that I try to use ' hg pull ' but I get an error saying ' bash: hg.exe: command not found ', but when I try to install mercurial with ' pip install Mercurial ' it outputs that ' Requirement already satisfied: Mercurial in c:\mozilla-build\python3\lib\site-packages (6.7) '. So I have it installed but it is not recognizing it. Am I missing something? Also as I am typing this I remembered that, before, when my PC did recognize that I had Mercurial I tried updating Mercurial but it got interrupted in the middle of the process by my anti-virus. Could that maybe be the reason I am having this issue? Thank you in advance and let me know if this question is better to be asked in another channel.","Source Documents:

"<@suppressed_user> hi all, I'm working on making some changes to the new tab hover preview feature and I have come up against a strange issue. I am trying to set up a MutationObserver to listen to changes on other elements in the frontend (to decide if the tab preview should be disabled or not), but when I try to set it up (even with a no-op callback function), I get an 'Unexpected NS_ERROR_FAILURE' in the console. There is a javascript traceback pointing to my call, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get a more descriptive error message. Has anyone here run into something like this before?

For example, you can rotate the context by 90 degrees (π/2 radians) and then draw the text. Here's a simple example:

var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.font = '20px Arial';
ctx.save();
ctx.translate(50, 100); // Move the context to the desired position
ctx.rotate(-Math.PI / 2); // Rotate the context 90 degrees counterclockwise
ctx.fillText('Vertical Text', 0, 0);
ctx.restore();
This code will draw the text ""Vertical Text"" vertically on the canvas."

"<@suppressed_user> Hi folks, I'm setting up a new macbook, and had no luck getting hg to pull mozilla-unified. bootstrap.py timed out, so I ran `hg pull https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified --debug` twice, and each time it got stuck on `adding xulrunner/tools/redit/redit.cpp revisions` and sat there until it timed out. (using git seems to have worked fine). Just wondering if that's a sign of a problem with the hg repo?

To work around this, you can download a Mercurial bundle of the mozilla-unified repository from https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/ (select the ""zstd (max)"" column for mozilla-unified). After downloading, initialize a new repository with hg init mozilla-unified, move the bundle file next to the mozilla-unified directory, rename it to bundle.hg, and run hg unbundle ../bundle.hg inside the mozilla-unified directory.

Source: xpcom/build/PoisonIOInterposerWin.cpp","The PoisonIOInterposer on Mac is designed to detect and report unintended I/O operations that could lead to performance issues or security vulnerabilities. It is called ""Poison"" because it interposes (or intercepts) I/O operations to identify and ""poison"" (mark or block) unsafe or unintended access patterns, leading to a controlled crash or alert. Disabling it on x64 Mac could allow for additional security hardening, but it is not enabled on Release builds due to potential performance impacts. The value lies in its ability to catch and diagnose problematic I/O operations during development and testing phases."

let xulStore = Components.classes[""@mozilla.org/xul/xulstore;1""]

I have already built the firefox on Linux and Windows, and was able to make name changes by changing MOZ_APP_NAME in several locations, it did changed the name, but the process running is still firefox-default on Linux and Nightly on Windows

Source: browser/components/newtab/docs/index.rst","To fully rebrand Firefox and ensure that the process names reflect your custom browser, you need to modify the branding files and possibly some build configuration files. Start by updating the branding directory under browser/branding with your custom icons, logos, and names. Ensure you change MOZ_APP_NAME and MOZ_APP_DISPLAYNAME in the moz.build and confvars.sh files. Additionally, you may need to update the application.ini file to reflect your custom names. For the process names, you might need to modify the firefox.exe and related binaries directly, which can be done by editing the source code where these names are defined, typically in nsAppRunner.cpp and other related files. For more detailed guidance, refer to the Mozilla Build Documentation (https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/directory_structure.html) and the branding documentation (https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding)."
